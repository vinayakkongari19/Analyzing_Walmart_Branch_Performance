# Unveiling Sales Trends: Analyzing Walmart's Branch Performance with Python

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing Walmart's sales data to uncover trends and provide actionable insights that can drive better sales strategies across different branches and product lines. By leveraging Python's data analysis capabilities, the project aims to identify key factors influencing sales and recommend strategies for optimization.

## Dataset
- `Invoice ID`: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- `Branch and City`: Location of the transaction.
- `Customer Type and Gender`: Demographics of customers.
- `Product Line`: Category of products purchased.
- `Unit Price, Quantity, and Total`: Pricing and quantity details.
- `Tax, COGS, Gross Margin, and Income`: Financial metrics associated with each transaction.
- `Payment Method`: Mode of payment (e.g., Cash, Ewallet, Credit Card).
- `Date and Time`: Timestamp of the transaction.
- `Rating`: Customer satisfaction rating.
The dataset consists of 1,000 entries with 17 attributes, all of which are non-null, ensuring completeness for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Developed comprehensive visualizations using Python's `matplotlib` and `seaborn`, analyzing sales distribution across branches, daily performance trends, and product line comparisons. Applied data aggregation and categorical sorting techniques to extract and represent key sales insights through countplot, lineplot, and boxplot,etc enabling detailed interpretation of sales patterns over time.

## Model Development and Evaluation 
 It then builds and evaluates two regression models—Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression—by splitting the data into training and testing sets(80:20). The models' performance is assessed using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) metrics, with results visualized through actual vs. predicted plots and residual distributions.

## Impact of the Project
- Identify high-performing branches and product lines: Understand which branches and products drive the most revenue.
- Optimize inventory and supply chain management: Based on sales patterns, make data-driven decisions regarding stock levels.
